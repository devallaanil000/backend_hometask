 1. Introduction
The PubMed Research Fetcher is a command-line tool designed to retrieve research papers from PubMed, extract non-academic author affiliations, and identify the corresponding author's email. The tool processes the data and outputs the results in a structured CSV file.

🚀 2. Approach
The project follows a modular design to ensure maintainability and scalability. The key components include:

Fetching PubMed IDs
Uses the Entrez API (esearch.fcgi) to fetch research paper IDs based on a given query.
Retrieving Detailed Paper Information
Calls the PubMed API (efetch.fcgi) to retrieve detailed XML data for each paper.
Extracting Key Information
Parses XML response using Python’s xml.etree.ElementTree.
Extracts:
PubMed ID
Title
Publication Date
Non-academic authors
Company affiliations
Corresponding author email
Saving Data to CSV
Uses Pandas to save extracted data in CSV format.
🛠️ 3. Methodology
3.1 Data Extraction Process
Query PubMed API with search terms.
Retrieve PubMed IDs matching the search query.
Fetch full paper details using the PubMed fetch API.
Extract relevant fields from XML response.
3.2 Identifying Non-Academic Authors
Affiliations are checked for keywords (e.g., "Inc", "Ltd", "Pharma", "Biotech").
If the affiliation matches a company, the author is classified as non-academic.
3.3 Extracting Corresponding Author Emails
Search for emails within affiliation sections of the XML response.
If no email is found, return "N/A".
📊 4. Results
✅ Successfully retrieved and processed research papers.
✅ Extracted PubMed IDs, Titles, Publication Dates, and Non-Academic Authors.
✅ Detected Company Affiliations for authors.
✅ Retrieved Corresponding Author Emails when available.
✅ Saved results to results.csv for further analysis.
